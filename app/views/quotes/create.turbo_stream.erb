<%# The first line tells Turbo to prepend to the Turbo Frame with id quotes 
the app/views/quotes/_quote.html.erb partial. As we can see, it's straightforward to pass 
a partial and locals to the turbo_stream helper.
The second line tells Turbo to update the Turbo Frame with id new_quote with empty content. %>
